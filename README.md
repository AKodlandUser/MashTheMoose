# Mash The Moose!
In this game, you'll have to click a moose repeatedly, and you'll have 60 seconds to do so. Depending on how many times you clicked it, you will have different grades. The moose will get faster every 15 seconds, so you must be prepared.
## How to play
This project incorporates functions that are not included in the Kodland HUB, such as sound effects and fonts.
So, you'll need to have [Python](https://python.org/downloads) and [Pygame Zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) installed and running on your computer.
Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/2hKUKgaiqfg) that can help you install them on Windows.

Then it's just as simple as enabling your virtual environment and writing `pgzrun moose.py` on your cmd. Enjoy!
