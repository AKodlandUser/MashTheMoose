# Mash The Moose!
In this game, you'll have to click a moose repeatedly, and you'll have 60 seconds to do so. Depending on how many times you clicked it, you will have different grades. The moose will get faster every 15 seconds, so you must be prepared.

## Grades
This game incorporates different grades depending on how many times you clicked on the moose. Here are the grades in order from worse to better.
* F grade: **Fail**

  You are definitely lazy, because you didn't really think of clicking the moose.
* B grade: **Bad**

  Your grade *could* be better, you just need to add a little bit more effort to your gameplay.
* A grade: **Awesome**

  Congratulations! This is the first *good* grade to be in the game. It symbolizes you completed the game, finally getting a good score.
* S grade: **Super**

  Wow! This grade means you made your gameplay even superior by adding  **even more** effort. Due to your dedication, you obtain the [**secret moose**](#secret) skin, which has a bigger hitbox, making your next gameplay easier.
* O grade: **Outstanding**

  Unbelievable! Your clicking has reached an enormous level! Now you have activated the [**ugly moose**](#ugly), which will make your gameplay slightly harder for a higher challenge!

  <dd>A square moose, the squareness giving it a bigger hitbox than the default one. The bigger hitbox makes the gameplay easier, making it easy to get more clicks.</dd>

  <dd>A round moose without antlers, the absence of antlers making its hitbox smaller. The smaller hitbox makes the gameplay harder and more challenging.</dd>
